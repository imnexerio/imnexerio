## Hi there 👋

🚀 Fuelled by Passion, Driven by Innovation! 🚀

As a Tech Enthusiast with a knack for Problem Solving, I’ve honed my skills in Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, Dart, and HTML/CSS. My journey in the tech world has led me to explore various domains, but my heart lies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. 🧠💻

🔬 Projects that I’m proud of:

- **🩺 Eye Health Monitoring System:** Leveraged ML models and health management technologies like Mediapipe, OpenCV, Flutter, KivyMD, and Matplotlib.
- **🤖 Hand Gesture Controlled Drone:** Developed using deep learning models and drone control technologies including Mediapipe and OpenCV.
- **🏙️ Smart Society Monitoring System:** An embedded system management project utilizing OpenCV, Arduino, and Customkinter for face-recognition and other functionalities.

🎖️ As an active member of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Society (AIMS - DTU), I’ve had the opportunity to organize the NSS IITR zonal in my college. These experiences have enriched my understanding of the field and have helped me grow as a professional.

📚 I’m a lifelong learner and have earned certifications in Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specializations from Coursera. I’m also skilled in Database Management Systems (SQL), Mobile Development (Flutter), and Designing (Figma).

I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and am excited to bring my skills and passion to a team that shares this vision. Let’s connect and shape the future together! 🌐
